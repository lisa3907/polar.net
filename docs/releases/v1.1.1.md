# PolarNet v1.1.1 â€” 2025-08-23

## Highlights
- Change: `CreateCheckoutAsync` now requires a non-empty `successUrl`; throws `ArgumentException` otherwise.
- Refactor: Consolidated `PolarClient` constructors by delegating to the handler-based overload (removed duplicate init logic).
- Docs: Standardized XML docs across the codebase (converted single-line summaries to multi-line, added explicit docs for `PolarWebhookEventHandlerBase` and `SendAsync`, clarified `Dispose` and pagination parameters).
- Webhooks/Tests: Added unit tests for signature verification, envelope parsing, and dispatch; improved sample webhook with an in-memory event store and a `GET /api/webhook/events` endpoint for E2E verification.

## Migration Notes
- Pass a valid `successUrl` when calling `CreateCheckoutAsync`.
- No other public API changes expected; existing consumers should continue to work.

## Targets
- netstandard2.0, netstandard2.1, net8.0, net9.0.

Thank you for using PolarNet!
