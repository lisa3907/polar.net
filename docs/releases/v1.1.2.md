## 🔄 Migration Guide

### From v1.1.1 to v1.1.2
No breaking changes - this is a purely additive release. Existing code will continue to work without modifications.

### New API Usage Examples

#### Creating a Refund
```csharp
var refund = await client.CreateRefundAsync(new CreateRefundRequest
{
    PaymentId = "payment_123",
    Amount = 1000, // Optional: partial refund amount in cents
    Reason = "Customer request"
});
```

#### Managing Webhooks
```csharp
// Create webhook endpoint
var endpoint = await client.CreateWebhookEndpointAsync(new CreateWebhookEndpointRequest
{
    Url = "https://yourdomain.com/webhook",
    Events = new[] { "order.created", "subscription.updated" }
});

// Test the endpoint
await client.TestWebhookEndpointAsync(endpoint.Id);
```

#### Listing Payments
```csharp
var payments = await client.ListPaymentsAsync(new ListPaymentsRequest
{
    CustomerId = "customer_123",
    Status = "succeeded",
    Limit = 20
});
```
