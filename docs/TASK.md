2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement typed exceptions (PolarApiException, PolarValidationException, etc.)
   - Add proper error response parsing
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **Testing Coverage**
   - Current test coverage is minimal
   - Need comprehensive unit tests for all APIs
   - Add integration tests with mock responses

### Medium Priority Improvements
4. **SDK Features**
   - Add synchronous method variants
   - Implement request/response interceptors
   - Add built-in rate limiting
   - Support for custom HTTP clients

5. **Documentation**
   - Complete XML documentation for all public APIs
   - Add code examples for each endpoint
   - Create migration guide from Python SDK

6. **Code Organization**
   - Consider splitting large partial classes
   - Add interface definitions for testability
   - Implement dependency injection support

### Low Priority Enhancements
7. **Performance**
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add caching layer for read operations
   - Optimize JSON serialization

8. **Developer Experience**

## 5. Breaking Changes to Consider

When implementing missing features, consider these potential breaking changes:

1. **Model Updates**: Adding missing properties might require nullable types
2. **Method Signatures**: Some methods may need additional parameters
3. **Return Types**: Some operations might need to return different types
4. **Namespace Changes**: Consider reorganizing namespaces for better structure
